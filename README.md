# Task4-SQL-Data-Analysis

#📊 SQL Data Analysis Internship Task

This repository contains my submission for the Data Analyst Internship – Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis.
The goal of this project is to create and query a structured e-commerce database using MySQL, and demonstrate SQL skills such as data manipulation, aggregation, joins, subqueries, views, and query optimization.

#🎯 Objectives of the Task

-Create and work with a relational database in MySQL.
-Perform data analysis using SQL queries.
-Use JOINs, subqueries, and aggregate functions for analysis.
-Create and query views for reusable insights.
-Optimize queries with indexes.
-Present query results with screenshots and a well-documented .sql script.

#🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

-MySQL Command Line Client – to write and execute SQL queries
-GitHub – to host and share the project repository
[VS Code / Notepad – to create the .sql file
-Screenshot Tool – to capture query outputs

#🗄️ Database Schema

I created a database named ecommerce_db with the following tables:
Table Name	   Description
customers 	   Stores customer details (ID, name, city)
products	     Stores product details (ID, name, category, price)
orders	       Stores order details (ID, customer ID, order date, total amount)
order_items	   Stores individual items within each order (order ID, product ID, quantity)

#📊 Key Queries Performed

This project demonstrates multiple types of SQL queries:

-Basic SELECT queries with WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY
-JOINs: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN
-Aggregate functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT()
-Subqueries for conditional filtering
-Views creation for reusable queries
-Indexes for query optimization

#📸 Screenshots

The folder screenshots/ contains images of the query results obtained from the MySQL Command Line Client. Each screenshot corresponds to a specific query for verification.

#📚 Learning Outcomes

-Gained practical experience writing and executing SQL queries.
-Learned how to build and query a relational database from scratch.
-Understood the use of JOINs, subqueries, and views in real-world scenarios.
-Learned how to optimize queries using indexes.
-Improved documentation and GitHub project presentation skills.
